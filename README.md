## Contributing

Thanks for your interest on contributing to reference, it's people like you that make [HelpBook.CN](https://helpbook.cn) such a amazing site ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰. Feel free to [submit issues](https://github.com/Fechin/reference/issues/new?assignee=Fechin) and enhancement requests.

**It's a good practice to refer to the cheatsheet of the [QuickRef Cheatsheet](https://helpbook.cn/quickref)**.


### Development setup

1. Clone Github repo `git clone https://github.com/Fechin/reference.git`
2. Install `npm` package manager (Read [installation guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
3. Run `npm install` in the root folder to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start a dev server. This serves the project and live reloads when any files are changed, then visit http://127.0.0.1:4000 preview.
5. Send us pull request and chill.

A `source/_posts/{filename}.md` file will be processed into a cheat sheet, let's create or edit a markdown file:

### Front Matter
```markdown
---
title: QuickRef
date: 2020-11-25 18:28:43
icon: icon-style
background: bg-emerald-600
tags:
categories:
- Other
  intro: This is a reference of styles that you can use on quickref cheatsheets!
---
```
Just need `title` and `intro`, and ignore other options. I will complete it if it can be released.

### CSS classes
QuickRefs uses [markdown-it-attrs](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs) and supports adding classes via its syntax. Also, there is a reference of styles that you can use on `helpbook.cn` cheat sheets:  https://helpbook.cn/quickref
